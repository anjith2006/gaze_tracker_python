An gaze tracker based on an OpenCV implemention of Python called SimpleCV [http://simplecv.org/].

The code was written in the spring of 2012(?) for an independent project in a computer vision class.
It connects to the webcam of the user; allows user to train the neural network by gazing at different (8 total) quadrants of the screen; and then began tracking the gaze in those 8 quadrants.

Requires a few Python libraries such as PyBrain [http://pybrain.org/] for Neural Net models and SimpleCV [http://simplecv.org/] as described above.

For more information on how it works, please read the PDF included, name "writeup".


p.s. Apology that I couldn't provide detailed instruction on how to run this code exactly (wrote it quite a while ago), but it should go something like this:
1. install all dependencies.
2. run "train.py" and follow the highlighted boxes on the computer screen (make sure to place your webcam and head at the center of the monitor before running it)
3. when #2 ends, run "gaze.py" and it'll start tracking (hopefully)
